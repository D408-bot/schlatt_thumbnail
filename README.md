# schlatt_thumbnail
A chrome extension that puts schlatt in every youtube thumbnail(i know the code is trash i dont know anything about javascript).
To get the extension go to Code->Download as ZIP, once its downloaded extract it, go to Chrome->Manage Extensions. Once there turn on developer mode, press Load Unpacked and find the "schlatt-reacts" folder.
